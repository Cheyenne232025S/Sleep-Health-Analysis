## Personal Comments
Now that I have learned more about MLR this semester, I notice that the residuals of model show room for major improvement.<br>
Future expansion ideas: improve model via data transformation and compare prediction accuracy between new and old model. I also now know how to make a prediction interval with a certain level of uncertainty that I want to add to the prediction. <br>

Additionally instead of having code in a way that you have to manually enter different predictors, I want to: <br>

- See if I can collect more data online to improve the accuracy of the fitted line to the model.
- Apply necessary data transformations to keep MLR model assumptions true (current QQ-plot shows non-normal distrubuted residuals)

- Run fake user data as an opportunity to make and work with a data base. This would allow me to evaluate and store multiple models to be compared as well as check for: oversimplifications of reality leading to potentialy needing to add an interactive term to the model, Bias detection (which groups the model mispredicts for), and multicollinearity.

Goals: <br>
- Gain more insight on the relationship amoungst predictors and their effects on stress.
- Improve the models prediction power on unseen data.
